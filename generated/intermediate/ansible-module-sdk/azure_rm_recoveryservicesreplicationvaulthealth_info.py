            The inner health errors. HealthError having a list of HealthError as
            child errors is problematic. InnerHealthError is used because this
            will prevent an infinite loop of structures when Hydra tries to
            auto-generate the contract. We are exposing the related health
            errors as inner health errors and all API consumers can utilize this
            in the same fashion as Exception -&gt; InnerException.
