            Name of the API. The name of the operation being performed on this
            particular object. It should match the action name that appears in
            RBAC / the event service. Examples of operations include: *
            Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action *
            Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action *
            Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write *
            Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read *
            Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete Each action should include,
            in order: (1) Resource Provider Namespace (2) Type hierarchy for
            which the action applies (e.g. server/databases for a SQL Azure
            database) (3) Read, Write, Action or Delete indicating which type
            applies. If it is a PUT/PATCH on a collection or named value, Write
            should be used. If it is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a
            DELETE, Delete should be used. If it is a POST, Action should be
            used. As a note: all resource providers would need to include the
            "{Resource Provider Namespace}/register/action" operation in their
            response. This API is used to register for their service, and should
            include details about the operation (e.g. a localized name for the
            resource provider + any special considerations like PII release)

                The provider. The localized friendly form of the resource
                provider name – it is expected to also include the
                publisher/company responsible. It should use Title Casing and
                begin with "Microsoft" for 1st party services. e.g. "Microsoft
                Monitoring Insights" or "Microsoft Compute."
          resource:
            description:
              - >-
                The resource. The localized friendly form of the resource
                related to this action/operation – it should match the public
                documentation for the resource provider. It should use Title
                Casing. This value should be unique for a particular URL type
                (e.g. nested types should *not* reuse their parent’s
                display.resource field). e.g. "Virtual Machines" or "Scheduler
                Job Collections", or "Virtual Machine VM Sizes" or "Scheduler
                Jobs"
          operation:
            description:
              - >-
                The operation. The localized friendly name for the operation, as
                it should be shown to the user. It should be concise (to fit in
                drop downs) but clear (i.e. self-documenting). It should use
                Title Casing. Prescriptive guidance: Read Create or Update
                Delete 'ActionName'
          description:
            description:
              - >-
                The description. The localized friendly description for the
                operation, as it should be shown to the user. It should be
                thorough, yet concise – it will be used in tool tips and
                detailed views. Prescriptive guidance for namespaces: Read any
                'display.provider' resource Create or Update any
                'display.provider' resource Delete any 'display.provider'
                resource Perform any other action on any 'display.provider'
                resource Prescriptive guidance for namespaces: Read any
